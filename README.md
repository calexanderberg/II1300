A lego robot project I completed in college
# II1300, Engineering Skills
## Introduction
Engineering Skills is a course with the overall aim  to provide knowledge of engineering practices and to provide basic skills in using different engineering tools, with emphasis on project methodology, presentation skills and computer as a working tool. 

As a part of this course I was told to, as a group, build a lego mindstorms robot with professional tasks in mind. What it meant to be an engineer, during this project students were told to write reports, plan meetings, split up work, apply roles, etc. 

## What was this project?
This Lego Mindstorms robot was build using the standard kit included in the lego set. The interesting part however was how we made the machine run C. We decided to download ev3dev and used the included c libary. The problem then was to find how to make the thread, the single wheel and the robot to work in general.

In the end we realized that using threads was not helpful to our code, however instead of fixing the robot and rewriting the code, we decided to rework the code and add a little sensor which would change the speed of the thread to account for these irregularities. 

## What technologies were used?
C

## What weâ€™re the biggest challenges?
Personally, I had never before worked with C or any statically typed languages. I had some previous experience with Javascript which was the most help I could imagine. Besides that I found the install process to be annoying at best, we also had a massive problem connecting the motors to the code. The code writing process was not difficult, or at least relatively not.

## What did you learn from it?
First of all I learned the basics of C. However more specifically I was able to learn how to install software on foreign hardware, how to debug, and google to find proper documentation. I also had a big issue with the overall code, but this entire process was more a struggle of finding out how to do something or fix something. Writing code is easy, finding what is wrong with a unique implementation of code with a limited community is difficult.

## When did you take this course?
August - November of 2020
